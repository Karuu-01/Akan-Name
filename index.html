      <h1>Akan Name Generator</h1>
      <p>
        Akan names come from a traditional naming system for people from
        countries such as Togo, Ivory Coast and Ghana. A child’s name is
        determined by factors surrounding his or her birth. For example, the day
        of their birth or the manner in which they were born may determine which
        name they get irrespective of their gender. These Akan names signify the
        day one is born. According to Akan tradition, each child is born with a
        name associated to their soul. The day the child is born is therefore
        determined by the soul. The well thought and organized naming system of
        the Akan’s was initiated by the ancestors and has attracted so many
        people’s attention as they desire to know more about these names. As a
        matter of fact, it is possible to tell what led to someone’s birth, the
        day they were born and their rank among the siblings just by their
        names.<a
