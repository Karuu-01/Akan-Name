      <h1>Akan Name Generator</h1>
      <p>
        Akan names come from a traditional naming system for people from
        countries such as Togo, Ivory Coast and Ghana. A childâ€™s name is
        determined by factors surrounding his or her birth. For example, the day
        of their birth or the manner in which they were born may determine which
        name they get irrespective of their gender. These Akan names signify the
        day one is born. Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently
        in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which
        corresponds to the day in the week they were born.<br> Here are Ghanian day
        names. <em>{Male} [Sunday: Kwasi] [Monday: Kwadwo] [Tuesday: Kwabena] [Wednesday:
        Kwaku] [Thursday: Yaw] [Friday: Kofi] [Saturday: Kwame] {Female} [Sunday: Akosua]
        [Monday: Adwoa] [Tuesday: Abenaa] [Wednesday: Akua] [Thursday: Yaa] [Friday: Afua]
        [Saturday: Ama]</em> Most people do know when their birthdays are, but some
        might not know what day of the week they were born. Luckily for us,
        there are ways to calculate the day of the week from a specific date.We'll do that
        using this Akan-Name Generator<a
